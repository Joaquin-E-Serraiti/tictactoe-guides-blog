            Have you ever wondered how many different combinations of plays
            there are in tic tac toe?
          </p>
          <p>
            I've created a map that displays all of them, with just 179 boards:

            It includes all the ramifications of plays and every possible
            outcome in the game: each win, loss and tie... (or something similar

          <h2>Concepts we will go through</h2>
          <ul id="firstUl">
            <li>
              <h3>Symmetry of the board: Rotations and reflections</h3>
              <p>
                Some plays are just rotated or reflected versions of other
                plays. Despite looking different, they are the same in terms of
                how they work strategically.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>3 extra rules of play</h3>
              <p>
                To avoid including irrelevant or unnecesary plays in the map, I
                implemented 3 extra rules that both players must follow in each
                of their turns.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>How to win in advance with double threats</h3>
              <p>
                Using double threats, players can force a future win,
                essentially winning 2 turns in advance.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>All games end at the 7th turn</h3>
              <p>
                Here is a demonstration of how you can always know the result of
                a game at the 7th turn, as if it was the end of the game.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The only 3 states of tie</h3>
              <p>
                All ties are just rotated or mirrored version of 3 states of the
                board. Here you will see what these 3 states are.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Winning sequences</h3>
              <p>
                These sequences are another way of forcing a future win. Unlike
                double threats, winning sequences let the players secure wins 4
                turns in advance.
              </p>

          <p>Are you interested?</p>
          <p>Let's get started.</p>
          <h2 id="Symmetry-of-the-board">
            Symmetry of the board: Rotations and reflections
          </h2>
          <p>
            I tried to avoid including unnecessary plays in the map and make it
            as compact as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do that, one of the things I did was apply the concept of board
            symmetry, with rotations and reflections.
          </p>
          <p>
            It helped me to rule out at least 2 thirds (66%) of all the possible
            plays that I was contemplating at the moment.
          </p>
          <p>Let me explain how it helped me:</p>
          <p>
            With the board symmetry in mind, you will notice that, in some
            cases, even if two plays are made in different cells of the board,
            they are strategically identical.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, they are just different versions of the same play: rotated
            or reflected versions.
          </p>
          <div class="imgDiv">
            <img
              loading="lazy"
              src="assets(2)/Article-1/empty-board.webp"
              width="700"
              height="400"
              alt="Empty tic-tac-toe board"
              style="padding: 0px calc(25vw * var(--sizeAdjust))"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Let’s put the first turn as an example: you may see that the board
            is empty and conclude that there are 9 different plays you can do,
            one for each empty cell. But many of those plays are just rotated or
            mirrored versions of each other.
          </p>
          <div id="rotatingAnimation">
            <img
              loading="lazy"
              src="assets(2)/Article-1/rotating-corners.webp"
              width="700"
              height="400"
              alt="Rotating board with one cross in the corner"
            />
            <img
              loading="lazy"
              src="assets(2)/Article-1/rotating-laterals.webp"
              width="700"
              height="400"
              alt="Rotating board with one cross in the side"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            In the first turn, playing in the top left corner is the same as
            playing in any other corner. The same applies to playing in the
            sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the different versions of a play can be obtained by rotating or
            mirroring the board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every play has either 1, 2, 4 or 8 different versions of itself
            (rotated and or reflected):
          </p>

          </div>
          <div class="imgDiv">

              alt="Examples of plays with many versions of itself (3)"
              style="padding: 0px calc(3vw * var(--sizeAdjust))"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            I considered the different versions of the same play as repeated
            plays and didn't include them in the map.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have multiple plays that are rotated or mirrored versions
            of each other, their ramifications will also be rotated or mirrored
            versions of each other:
          </p>
          <div id="pendulumAnimation">
            <img
              loading="lazy"
              id="pendulumBG"
              src="assets(2)/Article-1/rotating-ramifications(3).webp"
              width="700"

          </div>
          <p>
            Why did I say that the concept of board symmetry helped me to rule
            out at least 2 thirds (66%) of all the possible plays I was
            contemplating?
          </p>
          <p>
            Because, when making the map with all the ramifications of plays,
            instead of starting with 9 possibilities in the first turn, I
            started with 3: corner, side and center.

          <h2 id="3-extra-rules-of-play">3 extra rules of play</h2>
          <p>
            When making the map of all possible plays, I implemented 3 extra
            rules that both players must follow in every turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            These 3 rules narrow down the plays that the players can do by
            excluding those plays that are irrelevant or that would never be
            made in a serious game.
          </p>
          <p>Examples 1 and 2 show some of these types of plays:</p>
          <div class="imgDiv">

          </div>
          <div class="imgDiv">

          </div>
          <p>
            If a play goes against at least 1 of 3 rules, that play is not
            included in the map.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this, I made the map more compact, only including relevant and
            important plays.
          </p>
          <h3>RULE 1 - If you can win, win.</h3>
          <p>This is the simplest rule.</p>
          <p>
            If it is your turn and you are able to make a 3-in-a-row, you have
            to do it.
          </p>
          <p>It makes no sense to not win when you can win.</p>
          <h3>RULE 2 - If there is a threat, block it.</h3>
          <p>Here we introduce the concept of threat.</p>
          <p>
            By “threat” I mean a line (column, row or diagonal) with one empty
            cell and 2 cells occupied with the marks of the same player.

            I call it “threat” because by making one you are threatening to win
            in the next turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            After following the rule 1 without finding a possible win, look if
            there is a threat of your opponent. If there is one, block it by
            putting your mark in the empty cell of the line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not doing this will allow your opponent to win in their next turn,
            which also makes no sense.
          </p>
          <h3>RULE 3 - If you can force a future win, force it.</h3>
          <p>
            If you can’t make a 3-in-a-row and there is no opponent threat to
            block, then you have to check if there is a way for you to force a
            future win (a win that takes place in future turns).
          </p>
          <p>In case you are able to force a win, you have to do it.</p>
          <p>
            If you can force multiple wins, you have to go for the faster one,
            the one that takes less turns.
          </p>
          <p>There are only two ways in which you can force a future win:</p>
          <p>
            One way is by making double threats and the other one is by making
            winning sequences. These two concepts will be explained later in the
            article.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the map, I signaled the cases where there is a forced win with a
            purple frame.

            I didn’t signaled the cases where the player can’t avoid forcing a

            those cases:

            The plays that don’t comply with even 1 of the 3 rules (for example,
            not making a 3-in-a-row when you can do it) aren’t included in the
            map of all possible combinations of plays.
          </p>
          <p>
            With both players following this process, I made the map more
            compact and easy to read, while only including relevant plays.
          </p>
          <h2 id="Double-threats">How to win in advance with double threats</h2>
          <p>
            Double threats are one of the two strategies you can use to force a
            future win—as I mentioned in the 3rd rule of the 3 extra rules of
            play, above in the article.
          </p>
          <p>
            You make double threats by creating 2 threats (explained in the 2nd
            rule of the 3 extra rules of play) in the same turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            The opponent won’t be able to block both threats in their next turn,
            leaving you the possibility to make a 3-in-a-row.
          </p>
          <div class="imgDiv">
            <img
              loading="lazy"
              src="assets(2)/Article-1/double-threat-example.webp"
              width="700"

              alt="Example of a double threat"
              style="padding: 0px calc(0vw * var(--sizeAdjust))"
            />
          </div>
          <p>Double threats must be created in a single turn.</p>
          <p>
            If you try to make two threats in 2 turns, your opponent will have
            one turn in between to block the first threat, before you make the
            second one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your opponent should always block that first threat as long as they
            can’t make a 3-in-a-row (2nd rule of the 3 extra rules of play).
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the 2 lines of all double threats always share one cell: the
            cell where you played to make the double threat in one turn.
          </p>
          <div class="imgDiv">
            <img
              loading="lazy"

              style="padding: 0px calc(0vw * var(--sizeAdjust))"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Making a double threat will inevitably lead to a win because the
            opponent won’t be able to block both threats at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is a double threat, the result of the game is already
            decided.
          </p>
          <p>
            For that reason, I didn’t include the plays after double threats in
            the map.
          </p>
          <h3>CURIOUS QUESTION: Can you create a triple threat?</h3>
          <p>
            Sadly, “triple threats” aren’t possible. You can’t make more than 2
            threats in one turn.
          </p>
          <p>Why?</p>
          <p>
            To have a triple threat on the board there must be 3 threats, which
            is the same as 3 lines, each with 2 of your marks and 1 empty cell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those 3 threats must have been created in one turn, so all the 3
            lines share 1 cell occupied with your mark. Consequently, there have
            to be 4 of your marks (1 of the 4 marks being shared between the 3
            lines).
          </p>
          <div class="imgDiv">
            <img
              loading="lazy"
              src="assets(2)/Article-1/triple-threats-examples.webp"
              width="700"
              height="400"
              alt="2 hypothetical examples of triple threats"
              style="padding: 0px calc(17vw * var(--sizeAdjust))"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            To have 3 threats made in one turn, the board must have 3 empty
            cells and 4 cells occupied with your marks.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you were playing with O’s, the other player must have the same
            amount of marks in the board as you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that the board must have at least 4 cells occupied by
            you, 4 by your opponent and 3 empty cells. 11 cells in total, which
            is more than the 9 cells that the classic board has.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you were playing with X’s, the other player must have at least 3
            marks (4 minus 1) in the board.
          </p>
          <p>
            There has to be at least 4 cells occupied by you, 3 by your opponent
            and 3 empty cells. 10 in total, which is also more than 9.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either if you play with O’s or with X’s, the minimum amount of cells
            in the board needed to make 3 threats in one turn would be more than
            9.

          </div>
          <p>This is an important pattern in tic tac toe.</p>
          <p>
            If both players follow the 3 extra rules of play, you will see that
            every victory is achieved by first making a double threat.
          </p>
          <p>Here is a demonstration of why this occurs:</p>
          <p>
            Let’s consider a hypothetical scenario where a victory has already
            been achieved, meaning there is a 3-in-a-row in the board and the
            game has ended.
          </p>
          <p>You can imagine any board with a victory.</p>
          <p>
            Now, Let's rewind the game by two turns to examine the board before
            the victory occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
            The line of the board where previously was a 3-in-a-row, now has 1
            empty cell and 2 cells with the marks of the future winner.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is the definition of a threat: a line with 2 marks of the same
            player and one empty cell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because we went back 2 turns, now it would be the turn of the future
            losing player. But we know that they didn’t block the threat and
            their opponent made 3-in-a-row.
          </p>
          <p>Why didn’t they block that threat?</p>
          <p>There are only two alternatives:</p>
          <ul style="list-style: decimal">
            <li>
              <p>
                The loser, unintentionally or intentionally, left a threat
                without blocking despite being able to do it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The loser left a threat without blocking because there were
                multiple threats on the board and they couldn't block all in one
                turn.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The first alternative goes against the second rule of the 3 extra
            rules of play.
          </p>
          <p>
            And we know that a player can't create more than 2 threats in one
            turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, the only victories that appear in the map are those
            achieved through double threats.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short: If there hadn't been a double threat before the
            3-in-a-row, the player would have blocked the single threat, and
            nobody would have won.
          </p>
          <h2 id="All-games-end-at-the-7th-turn">
            All games end at the 7th turn (at most)
          </h2>
          <p>A classic game of tic tac toe has a maximum of 9 turns.</p>
          <p>
            If both players follow the 3 extra rules of play, you can always
            know how the game will end at the 7th turn.
          </p>
          <p>Essentially, you can treat the 7th turn as the end of the game.</p>
          <p>
            Because of that, I didn’t include plays beyond the 7th turn in the
            map of all possible plays.
          </p>
          <p>Let me explain how this works:</p>
          <p>
            First, we have to consider that a game of tic tac toe can only have
            1 of 2 results: a win and a loss or a tie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, because all victories are preceded by a double threat (as I
            commented previously in the article), we can know if any player is
            going to win 2 turns before the 3-in-a-row occurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            By knowing if there will be a win or not, we also know if there will
            be a tie or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, you can always know the result of the game at least 2
            turns before the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            You only need to check if there is a double threat present in the
            board after the 7th play is done. If the 7th play is done and there
            is no double threat, nobody will win in that game.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the map of all possible combinations of plays, if a game was
            going to end in a tie I just included the plays until the 6th turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did this because you can already tell if it is possible to make a
            double threat in the 7th turn or not with 6 marks on the board.
          </p>
          <p>The less plays I inlcude, the better.</p>

          <p>
            With this, the players force their opponents into blocking a threat
            that enables them to make a double threat, achieving a victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is basically a chain of forced moves for your opponent that ends

            start winning sequences in the 3rd and 5th turn, with X’s, or the
            4th turn, with O’s.
          </p>
          <h2>The trap ramification</h2>
          <p>
            In the map, there is one ramification that is different from all the
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually, if you make a play and your opponent can’t force a win in
            the next turn, you at least have the chance to tie.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you are playing with O's and enter this ramification,
            even if your opponent doesn't force a win right away, all the
            outcomes are losses for you.
          </p>
          <p>This is the ramification:</p>

            />
          </div>
          <p>
            This is the only ramification without any ties in it’s outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are playing with O's, never play into that ramification, or
            you will definitely lose.
          </p>
          <h2>Using forced plays to reduce the amount of boards in the map</h2>
          <p>
            When making the map of all possible plays, there were cases in
            which, instead of just adding 1 play per board, I could add 2,
            reducing the amount of boards needed to show all possible plays.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these cases, the players are forced to do an specific play by The
            3 extra rules of play. Examples are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                When the opponent makes a threat - The player is forced to block
                that threat.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                When it is possible to make a double threat - If there is no
                threat to block, the player is forced to make the double threat.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                When it is possible to make a winning sequence - If there is no
                threat to block and can’t make a double threat, the player has
                to make the winning sequence.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

            />
          </div>
          <p>
            This allowed me to make the map more compact, using less boards when
            the players are forced to do one play.
          </p>

                The wins are colored with green, for the player with X’s, and
                yellow, for the player with O’s. They aren’t the wins themselves
                (3-in-a-row), but the double threats that force the wins
                (explained in How to win in advance with double threats)

                Symmetry of the board: rotations and reflections) are “childs”
                of the same “parent” in the tree of possibilites, the rotated /

            Even though tic tac toe may be considered a simple game, there is a
            lot more to it than just placing circles and crosses in a 3 x 3
            board until someone makes a 3-in-a-row.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, you not only know about many patterns, concepts and
            strategies of the game, but you also understand better the map with
            all its possible combinations of plays.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see how many different combinations of plays there are in
            the game and how to reach each one of them.
          </p>
          <p>Every win, loss and tie is there for you to analyze.</p>
